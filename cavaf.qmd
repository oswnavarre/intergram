# Confusing Adjective vs. Adverb Forms

## Rule

**Adjectives** describe **nouns**, while **adverbs** describe **verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs**.  
Many adverbs end in **-ly**, but **not all -ly words are adverbs**, and some common adverbs **do not end in -ly**, which often causes confusion.

## Adjectives vs. adverbs: basic contrast

- **Adjective** → describes a noun  
  *She is a **careful** driver.*

- **Adverb** → describes how an action happens  
  *She drives **carefully**.*

::: {.callout-tip}
Ask yourself:  
Am I describing a **thing/person** (adjective) or an **action** (adverb)?

## Common confusing pairs

### good vs. well

- **good** → adjective  
  *She is a **good** teacher.*
- **well** → adverb / adjective for health  
  *She teaches **well**.*  
  *I feel **well** today.*

### fast / hard / late (same form)

These words can be **adjectives or adverbs**, and they **do not add -ly**.

- *He is a **fast** runner.* (adjective)  
- *He runs **fast**.* (adverb)

- *It was a **hard** test.* (adjective)  
- *She worked **hard**.* (adverb)

- *The bus was **late**.* (adjective)  
- *He arrived **late**.* (adverb)

### friendly / lively / lonely (adjectives only)

Some words ending in **-ly are adjectives**, not adverbs.

- *She is very **friendly**.*  
- *It was a **lively** discussion.*

❌ *She spoke friendly.*  
✅ *She spoke **in a friendly way**.*

## My examples

- *The instructions were **clear**, and the teacher explained them **clearly**.*
- *He is a **hard** worker, and he works **hard** every day.*

**Why they work:**  
The adjective describes a noun (*instructions, worker*), and the adverb
describes the action (*explained, works*).

## Real-world example (everyday language)

> *Please speak clearly.*

**Why it works:**  
The speaker is describing **how** the action (*speak*) should be done,
so an **adverb** is required.

::: {.callout-note}
These forms appear constantly in classroom instructions, presentations,
and workplace communication.

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *She did good on the exam.*  
  ✅ *She did **well** on the exam.*

- ❌ *He drives careful.*  
  ✅ *He drives **carefully**.*

- ❌ *She spoke friendly to the students.*  
  ✅ *She spoke **in a friendly way** to the students.*

## Mini comparison table

| Word | Adjective use | Adverb use |
|----|---------------|------------|
| good / well | *a good result* | *performed well* |
| fast | *a fast car* | *drive fast* |
| hard | *hard work* | *work hard* |
| late | *a late train* | *arrive late* |

## Why this grammar point matters

clear, accurate, and professional, especially in academic and spoken English.
