# Order of Adjectives

## Rule

In English, when we use **more than one adjective before a noun**, they usually follow a **natural and fixed order**.  
Native speakers don’t think about the rule consciously, but changing the order often sounds unnatural.

## The usual adjective order

**Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose → Noun**

### Example pattern

> *a **beautiful** **small** **old** **round** **brown** **Italian** **wooden** **coffee** table*

::: {.callout-tip}
You don’t need to use all categories. Most sentences use **two or three adjectives** at most.

## Common categories with examples

| Category | Example adjectives |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Opinion** | beautiful, interesting, terrible |
| **Size** | big, small, tiny |
| **Age** | old, new, modern |
| **Shape** | round, square, long |
| **Color** | red, blue, dark |
| **Origin** | Italian, Costa Rican |
| **Material** | wooden, metal, plastic |
| **Purpose** | coffee (table), running (shoes) |

## My examples

- *She bought a **beautiful small old house** near the university.*  
- *I use a **large new metal water bottle** every day.*

**Why they work:**  
The adjectives follow the expected order, so the sentences sound natural and fluent.

## Real-world example (everyday language)

> *a big old red bus*

**Why it works:**  
The speaker describes **size → age → color** before the noun, which follows the natural English pattern.

::: {.callout-note}
This order appears constantly in everyday speech, advertising, and product descriptions,
even if speakers are not aware of the rule.

## Common mistakes

  ✅ *a big red car*

- ❌ *a wooden old table*  
  ✅ *an old wooden table*

- ❌ *an Italian beautiful painting*  
  ✅ *a beautiful Italian painting*

## Mini practice check

## Why this grammar point matters

Correct adjective order helps learners sound **more natural and fluent**,
even when they already know many adjectives.
