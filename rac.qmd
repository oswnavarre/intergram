# Reduced Adjective Clauses

## Rule

A **reduced adjective clause** is a shorter version of an adjective (relative) clause.  
We reduce the clause **when the relative pronoun is the subject** and the verb is:
- **be + verb-ing**, or
- **be + adjective / noun**

The goal is to make sentences **shorter and more natural**, especially in writing.

## Basic reduction patterns

### 1. be + verb-ing → verb-ing

- Full clause:  
  *The student **who is studying** online needs help.*
- Reduced clause:  
  *The student **studying** online needs help.*

### 2. be + adjective / noun → adjective / noun phrase

- Full clause:  
  *The device **that is new** works well.*
- Reduced clause:  
  *The **new** device works well.*

You can only reduce the clause if **who/that/which is the subject** of the adjective clause.

## When you can reduce (and when you can’t)

### You **can** reduce:
- *The report **that is written** in English is clear.*  
  → *The report **written** in English is clear.*

### You **cannot** reduce:
- *The report **that I wrote** is clear.* ❌  
(“that” is the **object** of *wrote*, not the subject)

## My examples

- *Students **taking** online courses need good time management skills.*  
- *The files **stored** on the server are backed up daily.*  
- *Equipment **used** in the lab must be cleaned.*

**Why they work:**  
In each case, the relative pronoun is the **subject**, so the clause can be reduced.

## Real-world example (formal writing style)

> *Applicants **interested** in the position should apply online.*

**Why it works:**  
This structure is very common in **job ads, instructions, and academic writing**.
The reduced clause makes the sentence clear and concise.

::: {.callout-note}
Reduced adjective clauses are especially frequent in **written English**
(job postings, manuals, reports).

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *The man talking to I met yesterday.*  
  ✅ *The man **who I met** yesterday.* (cannot reduce)

- ❌ *The students are studying online need help.*  
  ✅ *The students **studying** online need help.*

- ❌ *The report that written in English is long.*  
  ✅ *The report **written** in English is long.*

## Mini comparison: full vs. reduced

- **Full:** *The book **which is used** in the course is expensive.*  
- **Reduced:** *The book **used** in the course is expensive.*

- **Full:** *The people **who are waiting** outside are students.*  
- **Reduced:** *The people **waiting** outside are students.*

## Why this grammar point matters

Reduced adjective clauses help learners write **more efficiently and professionally**, especially in academic and formal contexts.
