# Phrasal Modals

## Rule

**Phrasal modals** are multi-word expressions that work like modal verbs.
They express ideas such as **obligation, advice, expectation, or ability**.
They are common in everyday English because they often sound more natural than single modals.

## Common phrasal modals and meaning

| Phrasal modal | Meaning | Typical context |
|---|---|---|
| **have (got) to** | strong obligation / necessity | rules, deadlines |
| **be able to** | ability (present/future/past) | skills, possibility |
| **ought to** | advice / expectation (moral “should”) | recommendations |
| **be supposed to** | expectation / rule / plan | duties, rules, schedules |
| **be going to** | planned intention / strong prediction | plans, evidence |

## Form and grammar notes

### have (got) to
- **Present:** *I have to leave.* / *I’ve got to leave.*
- **Past:** *I had to leave.*
- **Negative:** *I don’t have to leave.* (no necessity)

::: {.callout-tip}
**Don’t have to** = not necessary  
**Mustn’t** = prohibited (very different meaning)
:::

### ought to
- *You ought to study more.*  
(“to” is part of the structure)

### be able to
- *I am able to help today.*  
- *I was able to fix it yesterday.* (useful when “could” is ambiguous)

### be supposed to
- *We are supposed to submit it by Friday.* (expectation / rule)
- *The bus is supposed to arrive at 8.* (schedule)

## When to use them

- **Obligation / necessity:** *I’ve got to finish this today.*
- **Advice / expectation:** *You ought to sleep earlier.*
- **Ability across tenses:** *She was able to solve it quickly.*
- **Rules / expectations / plans:** *You’re supposed to sign here.*

## My example

*I’ve got to update my Quarto site this week, and I’m supposed to submit the final link on time.*

**Why it works:**  
Both expressions communicate obligation/expectation in a natural way.

## Real-world example (TV series–style dialogue)

**Friends (dialogue style)**

> *We’re supposed to be there at 7.*  
> *I’ve got to go now.*

**Why it works:**  
These phrasal modals sound very natural in spoken English. They show:
- **expected plan/rule** (*supposed to*)
- **strong necessity** (*have got to*)

::: {.callout-note}
If video clips are blocked, a dialogue-style “real-world” example still reflects
authentic spoken English (the way people actually talk in sitcoms and daily life).

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *I have to to go.*  
  ✅ *I have to go.*

- ❌ *You ought study more.*  
  ✅ *You ought to study more.*

- ❌ *I don’t have to go = I mustn’t go.*  
  ✅ *I don’t have to go* (not necessary)  
  ✅ *I mustn’t go* (not allowed)

- ❌ *I am able to go yesterday.*  
  ✅ *I was able to go yesterday.*

## Mini comparison

- **must** (strong obligation, often formal)  
  *I must finish this report.*

- **have to / have got to** (strong obligation, very common in conversation)  
  *I’ve got to finish this report.*

- **should / ought to** (advice)  
  *You ought to rest.*

- **can / be able to** (ability; “be able to” works better across tenses)  
  *I wasn’t able to join the meeting yesterday.*
