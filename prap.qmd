# Polite Requests and Permission

## Rule

We use different structures to make **requests** or ask for **permission**
depending on how **polite or formal** we want to sound.  
Politeness in English often depends on **modal verbs**, **indirect language**,
and **social distance**.

## Asking for permission

### Common structures

- **Can I…?** → informal  
- **May I…?** → more formal  
- **Could I…?** → polite and common  

Examples:
- *Can I leave early today?*  
- *May I use your phone?*  
- *Could I ask a question?*

::: {.callout-tip}
**Could** sounds more polite than **can**, especially with strangers or in formal situations.

## Making requests

### From less to more polite

- **Can you…?** → informal  
- **Could you…?** → polite  
- **Would you mind…?** → very polite  

Examples:
- *Can you help me with this?*  
- *Could you explain that again?*  
- *Would you mind closing the window?*

::: {.callout-tip}
After **Would you mind…**, use **-ing**:
*Would you mind **opening** the door?*
:::

## My examples

- *Could you please review my draft?*  
- *Would you mind **waiting** a moment?*

**Why they work:**  
The speaker uses polite modal forms and indirect language to sound respectful.

## Real-world example (everyday interaction)

> *Could you please fill out this form?*

**Why it works:**  
This structure is common in offices, schools, and service situations.
It is polite without being too formal.

::: {.callout-note}
Polite requests are especially important in academic and professional contexts.

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *You close the door?*  
  ✅ *Could you close the door?*

- ❌ *Would you mind to help me?*  
  ✅ *Would you mind **helping** me?*

- ❌ *Can you please to send the file?*  
  ✅ *Can you please send the file?*

## Mini politeness scale

- **Very informal:** *Can you help me?*  
- **Polite:** *Could you help me?*  
- **Very polite:** *Would you mind helping me?*

## Why this grammar point matters

Using polite requests and permission forms correctly helps speakers
sound respectful, professional, and culturally appropriate in English.
