# Summary

This grammar scrapbook brings together the main grammar concepts covered in the **Intermediate Grammar Specialization** and presents them in a clear, organized, and practical way. Throughout the project, I reviewed and explained **15 key grammar points**, focusing not only on their form, but also on their meaning and real-life use.

Each section of the scrapbook combines explanations written in my own words, original examples, and authentic language drawn from everyday communication. This approach helped reinforce my understanding of grammar as a **tool for communication**, rather than as a set of isolated rules.

Working on this project also allowed me to identify grammar areas that require more attention and practice, while strengthening my ability to explain complex ideas in a simple and accessible way. In particular, contrasting similar structures—such as different verb tenses, modal expressions, and clause types—made the learning process more meaningful.

Overall, this scrapbook serves both as a **final reflection** on what I have learned and as a **personal reference resource** that I can continue using in the future. It demonstrates my progress in understanding and applying English grammar in a more confident and communicative manner.
