# Past Perfect Progressive

## Rule

We use the **past perfect progressive** to show that an action **started before a specific moment in the past** and **was still in progress up to that moment**.  
The focus is on the **duration or ongoing nature** of the activity, not just the result.

## Form

**had + been + verb-ing**

- I / You / We / They / He / She / It **had been + V-ing**  
  → *She had been working all night.*

## When to use it

- **Duration before a past moment**:  
  *He was tired because he had been studying for hours.*
- **Background action interrupted by another past event**:  
  *She had been waiting when the bus finally arrived.*
- **Explaining causes in the past**:  
  *They were angry because they had been arguing.*

::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to emphasize the **completed result**, use **past perfect simple** instead.  
*He had written three emails* (result) vs. *He had been writing emails* (activity).

## My example

*Before the semester ended, I had been reviewing grammar topics every week.*

**Why it works:**  
The reviewing started earlier and continued **up to a specific moment in the past** (the end of the semester).

## Real-world example (TV series – transcript)

**South Park** – Season 14, Episode 13 (episode script)

> *...a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival!*

**Why it works:**  
The cult started waiting **before** that past moment in the story and the waiting continued **up to that point**.  
The focus is on the **long duration** (“for years”) before the past event.

## Common mistakes

- ✅ *She was tired because she had been working all day.*  
  ❌ *She was tired because she had worked all day.* (possible, but focuses on result, not duration)

- ❌ *They had been wait for hours.*  
  ✅ *They had been waiting for hours.*

- ❌ *He had been studying since two hours.*  
  ✅ *He had been studying for two hours.*

## Mini timeline

- **Earlier past (ongoing)** → *had been + V-ing*  
- **Later past event** → *simple past*

Example:  
*I **had been driving** for hours when I **realized** I was lost.*

## Mini comparison

- **Past perfect simple** → completed action  
  *She had finished the report.*
- **Past perfect progressive** → duration / background action  
  *She had been working on the report all morning.*
