    "text": "This grammar scrapbook is the capstone project for the Intermediate Grammar Specialization.\nIts main purpose is to review, organize, and reflect on the most important grammar points covered throughout the program, while connecting them to real-life English usage.\nRather than presenting grammar as isolated rules, this scrapbook focuses on how grammar actually appears in everyday communication, such as conversations, classroom language, media, and professional contexts. Each grammar point is explained in my own words, followed by original examples and real-world examples that show how English is used naturally.\nThe scrapbook includes 15 key grammar topics, ranging from verb tenses and modal structures to adjective order and clause reduction. Each page follows a consistent structure to make the content clear and accessible:\na brief explanation of the rule, examples created by me, real-world language samples, and common mistakes learners often make.\nThis project also helped me become more aware of grammar in the English I encounter daily. While working on it, I noticed how often these structures appear in spoken English, written texts, and instructional language. As a result, the scrapbook is not only a review tool, but also a personal reference that I can return to in the future.\nOverall, this grammar scrapbook represents both a summary of what I have learned and a demonstration of my ability to use and explain English grammar meaningfully, beyond memorization of rules.",

    "text": "This grammar scrapbook brings together the main grammar concepts covered in the Intermediate Grammar Specialization and presents them in a clear, organized, and practical way. Throughout the project, I reviewed and explained 15 key grammar points, focusing not only on their form, but also on their meaning and real-life use.\nEach section of the scrapbook combines explanations written in my own words, original examples, and authentic language drawn from everyday communication. This approach helped reinforce my understanding of grammar as a tool for communication, rather than as a set of isolated rules.\nWorking on this project also allowed me to identify grammar areas that require more attention and practice, while strengthening my ability to explain complex ideas in a simple and accessible way. In particular, contrasting similar structures—such as different verb tenses, modal expressions, and clause types—made the learning process more meaningful.\nOverall, this scrapbook serves both as a final reflection on what I have learned and as a personal reference resource that I can continue using in the future. It demonstrates my progress in understanding and applying English grammar in a more confident and communicative manner.",
