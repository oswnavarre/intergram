# Past Perfect Simple

## Rule

We use the **past perfect simple** to talk about an action that was **completed before another action in the past**.  
It helps us make the order of past events clear when the sequence is important.

## Form

**had + past participle (V3)**

- I / You / We / They / He / She / It **had + V3**  
  → *She had finished the report.*

## When to use it

- **Two past actions, one happened first**:  
  *She left because she had finished her work.*
- **Reported speech** (looking back further in time):  
  *He said he had already seen the movie.*
- **Past cause → past result**:  
  *They were tired because they had worked all night.*

::: {.callout-tip}
If the order of events is already clear (for example, with **before/after**),
the simple past is sometimes enough.

## My example

*By the time the class started, I had already prepared all the materials.*

**Why it works:**  
Preparing the materials happened **before** the class started (both are in the past, but one is earlier).

## Real-world example (TV series)

**Friends** – Season 2

> *I had never seen anything like that before.*

**Why it works:**  
The experience (seeing something) happened **before** the moment the character is talking about in the past.

::: {.callout-note}
Past perfect is very common in TV series when characters explain
background information or earlier experiences.

## Common mistakes

- ✅ *When I arrived, they had already left.*  
  ❌ *When I arrived, they already left.* (sequence unclear)

- ✅ *She had finished her homework before she went out.*  
  ❌ *She finished her homework before she had gone out.* (wrong tense order)

- ❌ *She had went home.*  
  ✅ *She had gone home.* (use past participle, not past tense)

## Mini timeline

- **Earlier past** → *had + V3*  
- **Later past** → *simple past*

Example:  
*I realized I **had forgotten** my keys when I **got** to the office.*
