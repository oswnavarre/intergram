# Present Perfect Simple

## Rule

We use the **present perfect** to connect a past action to the present.  
The exact time is not important; the result or connection **now** is what matters.

## Form

**have/has + past participle (V3)**

- **I/You/We/They** have + V3 → *I have finished.*
- **He/She/It** has + V3 → *She has finished.*

## When to use it

- **Life experience** (no specific time): *I’ve visited Ecuador.*
- **Recent past with a present result**: *She has broken her arm* (it affects now).
- **Unfinished situation up to now** (often with *yet/already/just*): *I haven’t decided yet.*

::: {.callout-tip}
If you say **when** it happened (*yesterday, in 2020, last week*), you usually need **simple past**, not present perfect.
:::

## My example

*I have taught statistics for years, so I have seen many common grammar mistakes.*

**Why it works:** The action started in the past and has a clear connection to now (my experience today).

## Real-world example (song)

**U2 – “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For”** (official music video)

> I haven’t found what I’m looking for.

**Why it works:** The search started in the past and is still unfinished now, so the present connection is clear.

## Common mistakes

- ✅ *I have lived in Costa Rica for 3 years.* (still true now)  
  ❌ *I lived in Costa Rica for 3 years.* (sounds finished)

- ✅ *I have seen that movie.* (experience)  
  ✅ *I saw that movie last night.* (specific time → simple past)
