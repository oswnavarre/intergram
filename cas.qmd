# Comparatives and Superlatives

## Rule

We use **comparatives** to compare **two** people or things, and
**superlatives** to compare **three or more**.  
The form depends on the **length of the adjective** and whether it is irregular.

## Comparative adjectives

### Short adjectives (one syllable)

**adjective + -er**

- *small → smaller*
- *fast → faster*
- *tall → taller*

Examples:
- *This room is **smaller** than the other one.*
- *Data analysis is **faster** with better tools.*

### Long adjectives (two or more syllables)

**more + adjective**

- *more interesting*
- *more expensive*
- *more comfortable*

Examples:
- *Online classes are **more flexible** than traditional ones.*

::: {.callout-tip}
Some two-syllable adjectives (ending in **-y**) behave like short adjectives:
*happy → happier*

## Superlative adjectives

### Short adjectives

**the + adjective + -est**

- *small → the smallest*
- *fast → the fastest*

Examples:
- *This is **the easiest** topic in the unit.*

### Long adjectives

**the most + adjective**

- *the most important*
- *the most difficult*

Examples:
- *Grammar is one of **the most important** skills for clear communication.*

## Irregular forms

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| good | better | the best |
| bad | worse | the worst |
| far | farther / further | the farthest / the furthest |

## My examples

- *This explanation is **clearer** than the previous one.*
- *This is **the most useful** grammar page in the scrapbook.*

**Why they work:**  
The first sentence compares **two** explanations; the second compares **many** pages.

## Real-world example (everyday language)

> *This is the best option for beginners.*

**Why it works:**  
Advertising and everyday speech often use **superlatives** to highlight
something as the top choice among many options.

::: {.callout-note}
Comparatives and superlatives are very common in reviews, ads,
and informal recommendations.

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *more easier*  
  ✅ *easier*

- ❌ *the most fastest*  
  ✅ *the fastest*

- ❌ *She is more smart than her sister.*  
  ✅ *She is smarter than her sister.*

- ❌ *This is the better option.* (when comparing many)  
  ✅ *This is the best option.*

## Mini comparison

- **Comparative** → two items  
  *This task is harder than the last one.*

- **Superlative** → three or more  
  *This is the hardest task in the course.*

## Why this grammar point matters

Using comparatives and superlatives correctly helps speakers
make clear, natural comparisons in academic, professional,
and everyday contexts.
