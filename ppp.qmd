# Present Perfect Progressive

## Rule 

We use the **present perfect progressive** to show that an action **started in the past** and is **still continuing now**, or has **just recently stopped** but its effects are still visible.  
It emphasizes **duration** (how long) or the **ongoing activity**, not just the result.

## Form

**have/has + been + verb-ing**

- **I/You/We/They** have been + V-ing → *I have been studying.*
- **He/She/It** has been + V-ing → *She has been studying.*

### Common time expressions

- **for** + period → *for two hours, for three years*
- **since** + starting point → *since 2020, since Monday*
- **lately / recently / all day / all week**

## When to use it

- **Duration up to now** (ongoing): *I have been working here since 2022.*
- **Temporary activity** (not permanent): *She has been staying with a friend this week.*
- **Recent activity with present evidence**: *You’ve been running* (you’re sweaty now).

::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to emphasize the **result** more than the duration, you often use **present perfect simple** instead.
Example: *I’ve written three emails* (result) vs. *I’ve been writing emails* (activity).

## My example

*I have been building this grammar scrapbook for several weeks, and I’m still improving each page.*

**Why it works:** The project started in the past, it has continued over time, and it is still ongoing now.

## Real-world example (video)

**Bruno Mars – “Uptown Funk”**

> *Don’t believe me, just watch.*

(We use the song mainly as a **multimedia example**. Now here’s a present perfect progressive line that appears in many real conversations and interviews:)

**Interview-style example (real-world usage):**  
*We have been working on this project for months.*

**Why it works:** It highlights **how long** the work has continued up to the present.

## Common mistakes

- ✅ *I have been living in Costa Rica for 3 years.* (duration emphasized; still true)  
  ✅ *I have lived in Costa Rica for 3 years.* (also possible; more “state/result”)  
  ❌ *I am living in Costa Rica for 3 years.* (incorrect)

- ✅ *She has been studying all morning.* (activity + duration)  
  ❌ *She has been studied all morning.* (wrong form)

- ✅ *They have been waiting since 9:00.*  
  ❌ *They have been waiting from 9:00.* (use **since**, not from, for a starting point)

## Mini comparison: Simple vs Progressive

- **Present perfect simple** → result / completed count: *I’ve read 5 articles.*
- **Present perfect progressive** → activity / duration: *I’ve been reading articles all day.*
