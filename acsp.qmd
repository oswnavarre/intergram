# Adjective Clauses – Subject Pronouns 

## Rule

An **adjective clause** (relative clause) describes a noun.  
When the relative pronoun (**who / that / which**) is the **subject of the clause**,
we **must keep it** (we cannot omit it).

## Which pronoun to use

- **who** → for people  
  *The student **who** asked the question is here.*
- **which** → for things/animals  
  *The book **which** explains this topic is helpful.*
- **that** → for people or things (more informal/neutral)  
  *The app **that** I use is free.*

If the pronoun is the **subject**, you cannot delete it:
✅ *The teacher **who** explains clearly is popular.*  
❌ *The teacher explains clearly is popular.*

## How to recognize a “subject pronoun” clause

Look inside the adjective clause:

- If **who/that/which** is doing the verb → it’s the **subject**.
  - *who **teaches**…* → “who” teaches (subject)

Examples:
- *The man **who lives** next door is friendly.*  
- *The movie **that starts** at 7 is sold out.*  
- *The device **which measures** rainfall is accurate.*

## My examples

- *I have a colleague **who teaches** online statistics.*  
- *This is a website **that helps** learners practice grammar.*  
- *I bought a sensor **which measures** temperature and humidity.*

**Why they work:**  
In each adjective clause, the pronoun (**who/that/which**) is the **subject** of the verb
(*teaches / helps / measures*), so it cannot be omitted.

## Real-world example (everyday language)

> *Looking for someone **who can help** with English?*

**Why it works:**  
This type of sentence is common in ads, posts, and conversations.  
The clause **who can help** describes *someone*, and **who** is the subject of **can help**.

“Who/that/which as subject” clauses appear constantly in real communication:
advertisements, job posts, classroom instructions, and casual speech.

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *I know a person can fix computers.*  
  ✅ *I know a person **who** can fix computers.*

- ❌ *This is the book explains adjective clauses.*  
  ✅ *This is the book **that** explains adjective clauses.*

- ❌ *The phone which I bought yesterday is expensive.* (not wrong, but too formal sometimes)  
  ✅ *The phone **that** I bought yesterday is expensive.* (more common in speech)

## Mini comparison: subject vs. object pronoun (important)

- **Subject pronoun (cannot omit)**  
  *The woman **who lives** here is my neighbor.* ✅  
  (who = subject of lives)

- **Object pronoun (can omit)**  
  *The woman (**who**) I met yesterday is my neighbor.* ✅  
  (who = object of met → optional)

## Why this grammar point matters

Using adjective clauses correctly helps learners write and speak with more detail, without creating long, repetitive sentences.
