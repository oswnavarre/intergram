# Gerunds vs. Infinitives

## Rule

Some verbs in English are followed by a **gerund** (*verb + -ing*),
others by an **infinitive** (*to + base verb*), and a few can use **both**
with little or no change in meaning.  
This choice depends on the verb, not on the tense.

## Gerunds (-ing)

### Common verbs followed by gerunds

- enjoy  
- avoid  
- finish  
- consider  
- keep  
- suggest  

### Examples

- *I enjoy **teaching** statistics.*
- *She avoided **answering** the question.*
- *They finished **working** late.*

::: {.callout-tip}
Gerunds often describe **activities or experiences**.
:::

## Infinitives (to + verb)

### Common verbs followed by infinitives

- want  
- decide  
- plan  
- hope  
- need  
- agree  

### Examples

- *I want **to learn** more about grammar.*
- *They decided **to leave** early.*
- *She hopes **to improve** her English.*

::: {.callout-tip}
Infinitives often express **intentions, goals, or plans**.
:::

## Verbs that can use both (meaning stays similar)

- begin  
- start  
- continue  
- like  
- love  

Examples:
- *It started **raining**.*  
- *It started **to rain**.*

## Verbs that change meaning

| Verb | Gerund (-ing) | Infinitive (to + verb) |
|----|---------------|------------------------|
| **remember** | remember a past action | remember to do something |
| **stop** | stop an activity | stop in order to do something |
| **try** | experiment | make an effort |
| **forget** | forget a past action | forget to do something |

Examples:
- *I remember **locking** the door.* (memory)  
- *Remember **to lock** the door.* (instruction)

- *She stopped **smoking**.* (quit)  
- *She stopped **to smoke**.* (purpose)

## My examples

- *I enjoy **working** with real data, but I also like **to explain** grammar rules clearly.*
- *I remembered **saving** the file, but I forgot **to upload** it.*

**Why they work:**  
Each verb requires either a gerund or an infinitive depending on its meaning.

## Real-world example (everyday language)

> *Don’t forget **to bring** your ID.*

**Why it works:**  
In everyday instructions, **forget + to + verb** is used for actions
that are still expected to happen.

::: {.callout-note}
This contrast (past memory vs. future responsibility) is one of the most
important differences for learners.

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *I enjoy to teach.*  
  ✅ *I enjoy **teaching**.*

- ❌ *She decided going home.*  
  ✅ *She decided **to go** home.*

- ❌ *I stopped to study English.* (if you mean “quit”)  
  ✅ *I stopped **studying** English.*

## Mini comparison

- **Gerund** → activity or experience  
  *I like swimming.*

- **Infinitive** → intention or goal  
  *I like to swim before work.*

## Why this grammar point matters

Choosing between gerunds and infinitives correctly helps learners avoid very common errors and sound more natural in both speech and writing.
