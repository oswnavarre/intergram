# Introduction

This grammar scrapbook is the capstone project for the **Intermediate Grammar Specialization**.  
Its main purpose is to review, organize, and reflect on the most important grammar points covered throughout the program, while connecting them to **real-life English usage**.

Rather than presenting grammar as isolated rules, this scrapbook focuses on **how grammar actually appears in everyday communication**, such as conversations, classroom language, media, and professional contexts. Each grammar point is explained in **my own words**, followed by original examples and real-world examples that show how English is used naturally.

The scrapbook includes **15 key grammar topics**, ranging from verb tenses and modal structures to adjective order and clause reduction. Each page follows a consistent structure to make the content clear and accessible:  
a brief explanation of the rule, examples created by me, real-world language samples, and common mistakes learners often make.

This project also helped me become more aware of grammar in the English I encounter daily. While working on it, I noticed how often these structures appear in spoken English, written texts, and instructional language. As a result, the scrapbook is not only a review tool, but also a personal reference that I can return to in the future.

Overall, this grammar scrapbook represents both a **summary of what I have learned** and a demonstration of my ability to **use and explain English grammar meaningfully**, beyond memorization of rules.
