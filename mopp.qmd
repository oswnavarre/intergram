# Modals of Possibility and Probability


## Rule

We use **modals of possibility and probability** to express how sure or unsure we are
about a situation.  
They help us show **degrees of certainty**, not facts.

## Main modals and meaning

| Modal | Degree of certainty | Meaning |
|------|--------------------|---------|
| **might / may / could** | low–medium | something is possible |
| **must** | very high | we are almost sure |
| **can’t / couldn’t** | very low | something is almost impossible |

## Form

**modal + base verb**

- *She **might** be at home.*
- *They **must** be tired.*
- *He **can’t** be serious.*

::: {.callout-tip}
These modals are followed by the **base form** of the verb (no *to*, no *-s*).
:::

## When to use them

- **Guessing about the present**:  
  *He isn’t answering — he **might** be busy.*
- **Logical conclusions**:  
  *The lights are off; they **must** be asleep.*
- **Rejecting an idea**:  
  *That **can’t** be the answer.*

## My example

*Some students might feel confused at first, but they must improve with practice.*

**Why it works:**  
The speaker shows **uncertainty** (*might*) and then a **strong logical belief* (*must*).

## Real-world example (TV series – dialogue)

**Friends**

> *She must be stuck in traffic.*

**Why it works:**  
The speaker does not have complete information, but based on the situation,
they make a **logical conclusion** using **must**.

::: {.callout-note}
In everyday conversations and TV series, these modals are very common
for guessing, explaining, or reacting to situations.
:::

## Real-world example (news-style language)

> *The increase in temperatures could affect agricultural production.*

**Why it works:**  
News and reports often use **could** to express **possible consequences**
without sounding too certain.

## Common mistakes

- ❌ *She must to be tired.*  
  ✅ *She must be tired.*

- ❌ *He might is late.*  
  ✅ *He might be late.*

- ❌ *That mustn’t be true.* (wrong meaning)  
  ✅ *That can’t be true.* (logical impossibility)

## Mini comparison

- **might / may / could** → possibility  
  *It might rain later.*

- **must** → strong probability  
  *It must be raining; the streets are wet.*

- **can’t** → logical impossibility  
  *He can’t be at home; I just saw him leave.*

## Why this grammar point matters

These modals allow speakers to sound **natural, polite, and realistic** when
they are not 100 % sure, which is very common in real communication.
